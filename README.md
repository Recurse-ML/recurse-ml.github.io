# Style

> To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it.
> To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.
-- Charles Bukowski

1. Name posts using 1-2 (ideally 1) words.
    When using multiple words join them together, such as `applebanana.md` (cf. `appleBanana.md`, `apple-banana.md`).
    This is inspired by [sive.rs](sive.rs) and [paulgraham.com](paulgraham.com).
2. Write [one sentence](https://sive.rs/1s) per line.
    Use two newlines for paragraphs.
